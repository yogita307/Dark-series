                <p>Mario[e] is a fictional character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.
                     He is the title character of the Mario video game franchise and the mascot of Japanese 
                     video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his 
                     creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom,
                      his adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser.
                    Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities. Mario's 
                    fraternal twin brother and sidekick is Luigi.</p>
